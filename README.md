A quick and dirty searchable version of A Guide to Latin Conversation by Lanuesse &amp; Willby

Note: This is a very rough page resulting from reading the djvu scan of this wonderful book. I wanted something easily searchable so that's why I made this quick and dirty version. The original is wonderully typeset and can be seen [here](https://archive.org/details/lanusse-michel-wilby-stephen-guide-to-latin-conversation) or [here](https://archive.org/details/guidetolatinconv00lanu/mode/2up) on Archive.org. The slopy setup here is from me, not the original.
